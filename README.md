# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

#About Page

First I found a functioning navbar in bootstrap and copied the code to all three of the html pages.
To push the links to the right of the page I changed the margin right to margin left auto.
I then created a container to put in all of my information.
Inside the container I created two rows one for the About Me! and one for the img and the text.
For the container I added a little in line styling to change the look by adding a colored border and some padding.
Finally I added a container at the bottom for the sticky footer which needed some text alignment and background color.

#Portfolio Page

For the Portfolio page I also created a container with the same in line styling elements to keep the pages uniform.
Inside the container I created two columns within one row in the container and added place holder imgs.

#Contact Page

For the contact page I found a functioning contact page on bootstrap that I modified for my desired look.
For the container I repeted the in line styling from the previous pages again, to keep everything uniform.

#Style.css
In the css page I changed all the font to Verdana.
I gave the img on the about page some padding so the text was not right on top of it.
I gave the background of each html page a background img that I got from imgur.com and had it repeat on its x axis to stretch it out the length of the page.
I changed the header colors for each page to Purple.
